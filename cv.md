### About me:
I am a veterinarian. I worked in my field for more than 4 years. I got experience with working with people, dealing with stress, multitasking and many others. After I gave birth to my baby and I started my mathernity leave, I was encuraged by my husband to start programming. I always liked IT related topics, so the transition seemed natural to me. I have done some courses, practiced as much as I can and I am currently looking for a job in new field, while at the same time trying to learn some new things and gather more experience and knowledge.

### Skills:
I know Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I know how to use Sourcetree (which I think it's easier to work with than "pure" Git)

My latest exaple of code will be limited only to codewars challenge, really.

### Experience:
Experience - none official one, or nothing that I can currently think of...

### Education:
######  University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn

I am using English since my childhood. Currently I am using it daily, as my Husband is Hungarian and doesn't speak Polish (and I don't speak Hungarian). I don't have any offical certificate but I would put my knowledge level on solid C1 (/C2).
